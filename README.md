- **Modular Structure**: Organized into distinct packages, each addressing a specific aspect of Go development, allowing you to pick and choose the components you need.
- **Well-Documented APIs**: Comprehensive documentation, including package-level documentation, function comments, and usage examples, to facilitate quick understanding and adoption.
- **Robust Testing**: Rigorous unit tests and integration tests accompany each package, ensuring stability, reliability, and maintainability.
- **Open Source & Community-Driven**: The Toolkit is open-source under a permissive license, encouraging community contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Available Packages

The `toolkits` module currently offers the following packages:

1.  [**codec**](./codec): Utilities for encoding and decoding data in various formats.
2.  [**crypto**](./crypto): A unified and extensible framework for cryptographic operations, primarily password hashing and verification.
3.  [**decode**](./decode): Generic utilities for decoding various data structures.
4.  [**errors**](./errors): Enhanced error handling utilities, such as error wrapping, context propagation, and error inspection.
5.  [**helpers**](./helpers): A collection of small, reusable utility functions.
6.  [**identifier**](./identifier): Tools for generating and managing unique identifiers.
7.  [**io**](./io): Extended I/O utilities.
8.  [**mail**](./mail): Utilities for sending and managing emails.
9.  [**metrics**](./metrics): Tools and interfaces for collecting and exposing application metrics.
10. [**net**](./net): Network-related utilities.
11. [**slogx**](./slogx): Extensions and helpers for structured logging.
12. [**version**](./version): Utilities for managing and exposing application version information.

## Getting Started

### To incorporate packages from `toolkits` into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Add the dependency**:

- Add the `toolkits` module as a dependency in your `go.mod` file, specifying the latest version:

```bash
go get github.com/origadmin/toolkits@vX.Y.Z
```

- Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the desired version or `latest` to fetch the most recent release.

2. **Import required packages**:

- In your Go source files, import the necessary packages from `toolkits`:

```go
import (
    "github.com/origadmin/toolkits/crypto/hash"
    "github.com/origadmin/toolkits/errors"
    // ... and other packages as needed
)
```

3. **Use the toolkit components**:

- Refer to the package-specific documentation (e.g., `toolkits/crypto/README.md`) and examples to learn how to utilize the components in your code.
- You can access the documentation by running `godoc` locally or visiting the package documentation hosted on godoc.org.
